# Goal: PerunApp audit remediation — PLAN ONLY

**Date:** 2026-06-27
**Splinter session:** 1
**Target project:** /Users/uros/Documents/Private/Projects/PerunApp

## What we're building
A prioritized remediation plan (a task board) that turns the findings in
`AUDIT.md` into concrete, owned, verifiable engineering tasks. This is a
**planning deliverable only** — Uros has explicitly said "plan what has to be
fixed before we fix anything." No production code is to be written in this pass.

## Why
A full security / code-quality / dependency sweep (see `AUDIT.md`) surfaced
2 Critical, 5 High, 8 Medium findings plus cleanup. The two blocking-class
issues are: (S1) authorization is enforced only on the client and relies
entirely on Supabase RLS that we cannot see from the repo, and (A1) the tab
routing never renders `<Slot>`, so the six per-day route files are dead code.
Before touching anything we need a sequenced, costed plan.

## Constraints (must hold)
- **No production code changes in this pass.** Output is `board.md` only.
- Every finding in `AUDIT.md` (S1–S5, A1–A9, D1–D5) must map to at least one
  board task OR be explicitly listed as "deferred/tracked" with a reason.
- Each task must name in-bounds files and a verifiable Definition of Done.
- Respect phasing in AUDIT.md §4: Phase 1 = must-fix (S1, S3/S4, A1);
  Phase 2 = hygiene (S2, S5); Phase 3 = quality (A3, A4/A5, A2/A6/A7/A9, D2/D3/D4).
- Treat the client as untrusted; security fixes must be server-side (DB/RLS),
  not JS-only. (inferred — standard Supabase practice)

## Out of scope (explicitly not touching)
- Writing or editing any `.ts`/`.tsx`/SQL/config source files.
- Running `npm audit fix --force` or any dependency upgrade (D1 is track-only).
- The `.env` history scrub (only the public anon key is present today).
- Any new feature work beyond the audit findings.

## Open questions (blockers for executing Phase 1, NOT for producing the plan)
1. Are Supabase RLS policies enabled on `sessions`, `session_participants`,
   `profiles`? Can we get schema/policy read access? (Determines whether S1 is
   "verify" vs "build from scratch.")
2. Routing intent: delete the dead day-route files (recommended) vs. convert to
   real per-day routes? (A1)
3. "Weekly" limit semantics: Mon–Sun, rolling 7 days, or gym-defined? (S4)
4. Is there an admin/coach role, or member self-book only?

The plan must account for #1 by producing BOTH a "verify RLS" task and a
"implement RLS + server-side enforcement" task, gated on the answer.

## Definition of done
- `.tmnt/board.md` exists.
- Every AUDIT.md finding (S1–S5, A1–A9, D1–D5) appears in the board mapped to a
  task with an owner (Donny/Mikey/Raph), a verifiable DoD, and a Blocked-by /
  phase column — or is listed under a "Deferred / tracked" note with a reason.
- The four open questions above are carried into the board's Notes as Phase-1
  gates.
- No source files under `src/`, `app/`, or config were modified (verify:
  `git status --short` shows only `.tmnt/`, `AUDIT.md`, `.gitignore` changes).

## Revision 2026-06-27 — Phase-1 gate answers from Uros
The four open questions are now answered. This unblocks Phase 1 planning; the
board's blocked-by reasons tied to these gates are resolved.
1. **RLS visibility:** Uros will grant Supabase project/DB read access. T1
   (verify) proceeds once access lands; T2 scoping ("harden" vs "build") follows
   T1's findings.
2. **Routing intent:** **Delete** the six dead day-route files + `index.tsx`
   redirect (option a). Keep the single-screen + day-filter approach. T5 is now
   unblocked (pure deletion + verify).
3. **Weekly-limit semantics:** **Monday–Sunday calendar week.** Limit resets
   each Monday. T3/T4 build against this definition.
4. **Admin/coach role:** **Planned but not yet.** Design RLS member-self-book
   only for now, but structure policies so an elevated admin branch can be added
   later without a rewrite. T2 proceeds member-only.

Still required before T1 can actually run: Uros must grant the Supabase access.

## Revision 2026-06-27 (b) — Weekly-limit reset clarified (CORRECTS gate answer #3)
Uros: "Weekly limit for user should be reset on Sunday 00:00."
This supersedes the earlier "Monday–Sunday (resets Monday)" answer.
- **Week window = Sunday 00:00:00 → Saturday 23:59:59** (a Sunday-start week).
- Count resets at the boundary **Sunday 00:00**.
- Timezone: (inferred) the gym's local timezone — likely Europe/Belgrade given the
  Serbian UI strings. **CONFIRM with Uros** before T3/T4 are built; a UTC-vs-local
  mismatch would reset the limit at the wrong local hour.
- Affects T3 (RPC weekly count) and T4 (week filter) only. No effect on the
  current cleanup batch.

## Hand-off to Leonardo
Decompose `AUDIT.md` into a phased remediation `board.md`. This is a planning
pass — produce the board, do NOT dispatch specialists to write code. End your
synthesis with the board summary and the open questions so Splinter can take
them back to Uros for the Phase-1 gate decision.
